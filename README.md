Automatic Parking System by Jitin


Hello All,

I have applied for a Java Software Developer role with White Clarke Group, Sydney.

I have been contacted by Graeme McConnell from Employee First recruitment and engagement to undertake a technical test on Automatic Parking System.

I have completed the same and attaching the following :

Coding Assignment_Java.pdf ( describes the technical problem)
AutomaticParkingSystem.zip (containing the source code of the software build)
AutoParkingSystem_by_JitinSreenivasan.docx.zip (document containing working instructions on how to use the software)
Please acknowledge my email when you receive it.

Thanks,
Jitin
